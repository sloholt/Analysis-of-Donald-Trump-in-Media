The contrast between the fates of the fixer and his former boss could hardly have been more stark. But for the fact that he is sitting in the Oval Office, Trump could well be facing a criminal indictment on the same campaign-finance violation that sent Cohen to prison, which arose from payoffs made to the adult-film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. And as Trump was bestowing the honor on Woods, who, perhaps coincidentally, has agreed to design a course at a new Trump development in Dubai, hundreds of former federal prosecutors were signing an online letter that says the President’s behavior toward the Russia investigation more than justified another indictment—for obstruction of justice.

And what would come of it? “I think the thing I’m worst at is managing the press,” he said. “The thing I’m best at is business and conceiving. The press portrays me as a wild flamethrower.

Her companyreceived three of those Chinese trademarks, for jewelry, bags, and spa services, on April 6—the same day she joined her father and Chinese President Xi Jinping for dinner at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, though there was nothing to suggest the timing was anything more than a coincidence.
